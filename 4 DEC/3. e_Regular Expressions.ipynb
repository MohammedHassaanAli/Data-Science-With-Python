More interestingly, searching for foo.$ in 'foo1\\nfoo2\\n' matches ‘foo2’ normally, but ‘foo1’ in MULTILINE mode; searching for a single $ in 'foo\\n' will find two (empty) matches: one just before the newline, and one at the end of the string.\n",

Sometimes this behaviour isn’t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against <a> b <c>, it will match the entire string, and not just <a>.
